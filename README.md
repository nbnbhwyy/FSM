![ABC](https://github.com/nbnbhwyy/FSM/blob/main/Flowchart.png) 

## Installation
First install the dependencies via conda:
 * sklearn
 * numpy
 * Python >= 3.7

 
### Quick start
We provide an example script to run experiments on our dataset: 

- Run `python FSM.py`: predict drug-drug combinations, and evaluate the results with cross-validation. 

**Note:** For a detailed description of the data, please refer to the section below.
